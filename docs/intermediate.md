# YubiHSM Provisioning Guide for PVT1 Programming

Perform the following steps to provision a YubiHSM for PVT1 programming.
It's worth noting that the `offline-keystore` tool was designed for a specific purpose and this ain't it.
It does however have all of the functionality we require, we just have to pass in additional options to override defaults that don't make sense when setting up an intermediate.

NOTE: All of the following assumes that you have the `yubihsm-connector` setup and running.

1. Follow the instructions from YubiCo to either reset the device with a physical mechanism as is required if you donâ€™t know your password, or using the yubihsm-shel if you do: https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Usage_Guides/Factory_reset.html
1. Checkout the `offline-keystore` repo: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/offline-keystore
1. Initialize the YubiHSM:
    ``` sh
    $ cargo run --bin oks -- --transport http \
        hsm --no-backup \
        initialize --passwd-challenge
    ```
    NOTE: `--transport http` causes commands to be routed through the `yubihsm-connector` by way of http
    NOTE: `--no-backup` disables the wrap key creation and splitting we do for the offline roots
    NOTE: `--passwd-challenge` disables the passwd mgmt flows we do for the offline roots & will challenge you for a password on the console. Pick a strong password, preferably one generated by a password manager and stored in same.
1. Generate the identity signing key:
    ```sh
    $ cargo run --bin oks -- --transport http \
	    hsm --no-backup \
        generate \
	    --key-spec data/platform-identity-intermediate.keyspec.json
    ```
    NOTE: the keyspec file is checked into the `offline-keystore` repo
1. Generate the directory structure and config file for the openssl CA:
    ```sh
    $ cargo run --bin oks -- --transport http \
        ca initialize \
        --key-spec data/platform-identity-intermediate.keyspec.json
    ```

## What happened?

At the end of all of this the HSM has:
1. created an auth credential w/ a password set by the caller
1. extracted the certificate for the attestation key on the YubiHSM: `output/hsm.attest.cert.pem`
1. deleted the default auth credential created when the device was reset
1. created a signing key per the provided keyspec, this will be the key used by our intermediate CA for signing certs
1. collected an attestation by the YubiHSM proving the key created was created on this specific YubiHSM: `output/platform-identity-intermediate-pvt1.attest.cert.pem`
1. created a directory structure and config as required by the `openssl ca` command using the YubiHSM as a signing back-end: `ca-state/platform-identity-intermediate-pvt1`
1. created a CSR for the signing key such that it can be certified and included into an existing PKI: `output/platform-identity-intermediate-pvt1.csr.pem`
